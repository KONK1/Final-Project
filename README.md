The game that will be created will consist of four mini-games. Their will be a main menu with a button for each game. Each game will have a game over screen and a winning screen. The four games will be Connect Four, Snake, Air Hockey, and Duck Hunter.

The Connect Four will be played by two players. The pieces will appear in the middle of the screen above the leftmost row. The players must use the arrow keys to control the side to side movement of the piece. When the piece is above the desired row then player will press the down arrow to place the piece on the board. Immediately following this, the other player's piece will  appear at the top of the screen and he will do the same thing the other player did. The goal of the game is to get four of your pieces in a row. This can be accomplished diagonally, horizontally, or vertically. After a player has won, a point will be added to his score and then they have the option to restart the game or return to the game menu.
